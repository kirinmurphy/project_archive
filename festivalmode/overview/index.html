  <h2>What's the Problem?</h2>
</header>
<div class="content"><div class="inner">
  <p>A few years ago, I was at my 2nd Riot Fest in Chicago. It was pretty great.</p>

  <p>But while cruising around the grounds for all of the great music, food and overpriced beer, at times it was a real hassle to link up with friends.</p>

  <p>All the texting and resending failed messages and waiting and re-routing to unfamiliar landmarks made me miss seeing those scary South African rappers and the beginning of the Flaming Lips set.</p>

  <p>Tragic.</p>

  <h2>What's Already Out There?</h2>

  <p>A quick search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=share+location+app">share location app</a> offers plenty of options to connect with nearby friends.  <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3033913/these-delivery-startups-are-racing-to-build-the-best-eta-engine-on-the-block">Business is booming</a> for location-based services, and undoubtedly options for users will continue to grow.</p>

  <p>There are lots of services for <a href="http://appcrawlr.com/iphone-apps/best-apps-concert-goers">ticketing, lineup and playlist information</a> for concerts.  However, it appears there are no consumer apps that help better connect users to the locations themselves.</p>

  <p>There are also services like <a href="http://www.crowdtorch.com/">this</a> and <a href="http://tapwalk.com/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.audioconexus.com/products/tour-apps/">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.tourappbuilder.com/">this other one</a> that will build custom apps for events and venues.  But downloading a new app for each event is not optimal.</p>

  <h2>Do we really need another app?</h2>
</header>
<div class="content"><div class="inner">
  <p>Maybe.  Well, it depends...</p>

  <p>For friend finding alone, there are options out there right now that would be enough to make me happy.  However no app was strong in every single category and there is definitely room for growth in this niche.  That is unless Google makes a handful of tweaks to its service, then ignore the last sentence.</p>

  <p>What's missing is connecting with places.  This is less of a technology solution than a data one.  Success would depend largely on the ability to manually source this data from event organizers themselves.  At best, this would be labor intensive and costly to scale. At worst, organizers may just not be interested, leaving few (if any) options to get that data.</p>

  <p>However, the prevalence of one-off event app providors implies that there is a market here.  With enough of a user base, a partnership would provide event organizers (and their vendors) another unique channel to connect with this semi-captive audience.</p>

  <p>The optimal case would be to partner up with some cool hipster brand already in the space.  Integrating the app with <a href="http://www.songkick.com/">Songkick</a> or selling it to Pitchfork would certainly make people more likely to return phone calls.</p>

  <div class="open-questions">
    <h4>Is account creation necessary?</h4>
    <p>The authentication scheme here was primarily influenced by Snapchat's model.  Though after reviewing some competing tools that didn't require authentication, I started to consider possible alternatives.  Since a mobile app's state can persist on a user's device, the only time re-authentication is really necessary is if the app (or the OS) needs to be re-installed or transferred to a new device.  And keeping the whole app behind an authentication firewall will ensure some level of drop off in sign ups.  Need to consider a design that allows users to play around in the app prior to being required to create an account.</p>

    <h4>To Facebook connect or not to Facebook connect?</h4>
    <p>Initially I considered designing around a Facebook authentication as the primary contact source, however ultimately decided to start with the phone contacts.  Facebook should return a larger set of contacts, however someone's phone contacts are probably more likely people they would expect to see in real life.  And then there's always a few people that don't have Facebook.    Facebook would provide immediate avatars, though that's probably not enough of a factor to tip the scales.  Also linking to Facebook down the line is something to consider,  However there would need to a way to deal with duplicates from different sources.</p>

  </a>
  <div class="open-questions">
    <h4>What map tool is right for this app?</h4>
    <p>The use case for maps in this app differ considerably with the core functionality found in most map tools.  The spaces accessed will most often be uncharted areas with transient landmarks.  Google Maps amazing database of local business information won't be able to tell you where a makeshift stage or first aid station will be.  While all map tools share these drawbacks, it appears that <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a> does have a bit of an edge over Google Maps in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/in-sochi-open-source-maps-beat-googles/283909/">charting private spaces</a>.  Also it's free.</p>
    <h4>Where to start?</h4>
    <p>A number of other apps start with the map view.  They put you directly in the experience from the get go.  However many also have somewhat obscurred online/offline modes, and app store feedback indicates that some percentage of people are worried about being tracked when they're not online.  So in this design, I require an explicit action to start sharing in hopes of alleviating those fears.  The compromise is that the real meat of the app (the proximity data), is behind another click.  It did not lead to any concerns during user testing, though there is certainly room here to create a more engaging landing page.</p>
    <h4>Invisibility</h4>
    <p>I was asked in a test session if you could see the map without sharing your location. Or just share a fixed map point not directly connected to your GPS.  There is still benefit in being invisible and connecting with places.  This is a tough one.  This feature would certainly be appealing to some users. However it does not promote sociability, which would be essential for the early success of the app.  There is a feature to indivudally hide yourself from someone's map, which should give users that flexibility without making it the default state.  </p>
