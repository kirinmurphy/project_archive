I'm a tooltip! I appear on the <strong>left</strong> of the trigger because it is on the right half of the screen.<br/><br/>
My content was created in a separate HTML file and loaded via AJAX!
<br/><br/>
I also have a setting called <strong>setToFixedPosition</strong> that is set to <strong>true</strong> so that I stay in the same place even when the page is scrolled!
