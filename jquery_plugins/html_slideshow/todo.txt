IDs vs. classes:

classes are intended for elements that share the same 
id's are intended to represent a variable for a single unique page element.

it is possible to write html completely with classes with no difference.  

Early javascript dealt better with classes than ids, but now that browsers are faster and libraries like jQuery exist, the performance benefit of using IDs is somewhat marginal.  

The only benefit of using IDs is semantics.  It identifies an element to a developer as a single 
It also makes id's excellent scope encapsulators for css rules because there is not a chance of that id being used for another purpose on the page.
