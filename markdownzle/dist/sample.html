    <p>I am the first sentence in the first section. I am the second sentence in the first paragraph of the first section. Soon there will be a second paragraph in the first section. So we can see how things are separated.</p>
    <p>I am the first sentence of the second paragraph of the first section. Hopefully people are still reading. Studies show that someone makes a decision to continue reading after the first 10-15 seconds, so by this point, people may be already starting
      to checkout of this content. I should have started with something about Nicki Minaj or Kendal Jenner&apos;s underboob instagram pics or something. I&apos;ll post a link later.</p>

    <p>I am the first sentence in the first paragraph of the second section. I guess I don&apos;t know yet if there will be a second paragraph, so it might not <a href="#15">Jump Link</a> be accurate to say the &quot;first&quot; paragraph. I should have omitted
      that. Or maybe &quot;the first of possibly many paragraphs&quot; is more descriptive. That one works. It&apos;s got an optimistic feel that I think will make people more willing to believe whatever next bull i say.</p>

    <p>See. The paragraph in the second section was right to consider that possibility. There was no second paragraph in the second section. It&apos;s hard to say if that was how it would have always gone, or that by suggesting it the sentences in section
      two pushed that idea into the zeitgeist and the desire to see those words come true were so subliminally strong that it was impossible for a second paragraph to have been written. Perhaps well talk about that more in the next paragraph. if there
      is one...</p>

        <p>At this point you should be aware of the fact that this is all just a game to pull you in to the madness that we can expect from someone who stares at screens for so many waking hours. Eventually there will be revolt. And we will all realize,
          who really cares if there&apos;s a second paragraph here, a third there... eveerything is falling apart all around us and we&apos;re taking the time to ponder the way the world would have been different if there was a second paragraph? I&apos;m
          sorry but that doesn&apos;t really make sense. Think about it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a point I&apos;m trying to make
            <ul>
              <li>This is a separate distinct reason to support the point I&apos;m trying to make</li>
              <li>This may also be a unique reason to suppor the point, though this could also just be some filler to legitimize the desire to create the first sub bullet point</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Obviously we need second bullet here. Obviously.</li>
          <li>This one is not necessary but I just wanna see how it looks.</li>
