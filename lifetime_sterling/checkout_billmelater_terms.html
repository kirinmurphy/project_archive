I will request a  loan on this Account by choosing the Bill Me Later Payment System when I make a  purchase from a Merchant at a web site, by telephone, or at another authorized  location. Purchases will be added to the balance of the Standard Purchases part  of the Account, unless they are subject to special terms for Promotional or  Installment Purchases. You will charge a Finance Charge on all parts of this  Account, beginning on each transaction date, except during the Grace Period and  as otherwise provided in the paragraph of this Agreement called "Finance  Charge."

    <strong class="boldbodytext">3. HOW I AGREE TO THIS  AGREEMENT.</strong> I agree to this Agreement and I make the promises it contains by  doing either of the following: <br>

    <br>
    <strong class="boldbodytext">a. Requesting an Account.</strong> I may request an Account in any of the ways you  may provide.<br>
    <strong class="boldbodytext">b. Using Bill Me Later after I receive this Agreement.</strong> If I obtain a  Closed-end Loan from you, you may send me information about Bill Me Later,  including this Agreement. By using Bill Me Later after I receive this  Agreement, I agree to this Agreement. <br>
    <br>
    <strong class="boldbodytext">4. HOW I CAN OBTAIN LOANS  ON THIS ACCOUNT.</strong> <br>

    <br>
    <strong class="boldbodytext">a. Standard and Promotional Purchases.</strong> I can obtain loans on  this Account by choosing the Bill Me Later Payment System when I make a  purchase from a Merchant at a web site, by telephone, or at another authorized  location. You will make a loan to me, in the amount of the Cost of the  purchase, by paying the Merchant on my behalf. You will make loans subject to  the Standard Purchase terms, unless special Promotional terms are in effect at  the time of the loan or are offered by the Merchant.<br>
    <span class="boldbodytext">b. Installment Purchase. </span>You may offer me the opportunity to make  purchases from some Merchants as Installment Purchases. You may offer this as  the only method I can use to make a purchase from a Merchant, or as an option  to the Standard Purchase method. If I make an Installment Purchase, the  Merchant will inform me if it is a Financed Installment Purchase and of the  payment amount and terms, before I agree to the purchase.<br>
    <span class="boldbodytext">c. Refinance of Closed-end Loan.</span> If I have any unpaid Closed-end Loans  from you at the time I open this Account, I request that you refinance the  Closed-end Loans by making a loan from this Account. The loans will be from  Installment Purchase parts of the Account, subject to the same Finance Charges,  if any, payment terms and End Dates as the Closed-end Loans that were  refinanced.&nbsp; <br>

    <span class="boldbodytext">d. Other Agreements about Obtaining Loans. <br>
    (i) No Pre-Established Credit Line. </span>There is no  pre-established credit line for this Account, but I understand that you may  evaluate each request for a loan at the time I make the request. You have the  option to refuse my request for any loan, but you will notify me of the reasons  for any refusal.&nbsp; <br>
    <span class="boldbodytext">(ii) You may charge my Account for Purchases.</span> I authorize you to charge  this Account for the Cost of any purchase I, or anyone to whom I have given  permission to use this Account, make from a Merchant using Bill Me Later. I  understand that the amount that you actually pay to the Merchant may be less  than the Cost, because the Merchant may agree that you may retain a portion of  the Cost in order to participate in Bill Me Later.<br>
    <span class="boldbodytext">(iii) You may charge my Account for Finance Charges and Other Charges.</span> I  authorize you to charge this Account for Finance Charges, any Other Charges,  costs of collection, and amounts that I agree in this Agreement to pay. <br>

    <br>
    <span class="boldbodytext">5. MY PERSONAL  INFORMATION.</span> Each time I choose Bill Me Later, I authorize the Merchant to  share my personal information with you to the extent necessary for you to make  a credit decision and complete the transaction, including paying the Merchant  on my behalf, opening my Account, charging my Account for the Costs of the  purchase, sending me a billing statement, servicing my Account and for all  other lawful purposes in connection with this Account.

I have the right to  withdraw this authorization at any time by informing you that I do not want you  to use the information from my checks to make an electronic fund transfer; to  do so, I must contact you in writing at Electronic Check Opt Out, P.O. Box  4415, Timonium, MD 21094 and provide you with my name, Bill Me Later account  number and the name of the financial institution and account number from which  my checks are drawn.</p>

  <li><span class="boldbodytext">Deferred Payment Option. </span>From time to time, you may offer  Promotional Purchases with a Deferred Payment option. All purchases subject to  the same rate, terms, Deferred Payment option and Expiration Date will be a  single part; at your option, you may consider any Deferred Payment option  purchase to be a separate part, or may consider Deferred Payment option  purchases from different Merchants to be different parts. If I pay the balance  on the Deferred Payment part (which is called the "Current Balance")  in full by the Expiration Date, you will not charge any Finance Charge for that  part. You will calculate the Finance Charge for each Billing Cycle prior to the  Expiration Date and disclose it on the Billing Statement as the Accrued  Deferred Finance Charge. If I do not pay the balance on a Deferred Payment part  of the Account before the Expiration Date, you may charge my Account, in the  Billing Cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs, Finance Charges on each  Promotional Purchase from the date of each purchase (each "transaction  date"). </li>

  <li><span class="boldbodytext">Deferred Interest Option.</span> From time to time, you may offer  Promotional Purchases with a Deferred Interest option. All purchases subject to  the same rate, terms, Deferred Interest option and Expiration Date will be a  single part; at your option, you may consider any Deferred Interest option  purchase to be a separate part, or may consider Deferred Interest option  purchases from different Merchants to be different parts. If I pay the balance  on the Deferred Interest part (which is called the "Current Balance")  in full by the Expiration Date, you will not charge any Finance Charge for that  part. You will calculate the Finance Charge for each Billing Cycle prior to the  Expiration Date and disclose it on the Billing Statement as the Accrued  Deferred Finance Charge. If I do not pay the balance on a Deferred Interest  part of the Account before the Expiration Date, you may charge my Account, in  the Billing Cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs, Finance Charges on each  Promotional Purchase from the date of each purchase (each "transaction  date"). </li>
  <li><span class="boldbodytext">End of Promotional Terms.</span> If a part is subject to a special  promotional rate, term, Deferred Payment option, or Deferred Interest option  which ends as of a certain date (“expiration date”), I authorize you to move,  on or after that date, the balance remaining in that part to the Standard  Purchases part of the Account, and it will be subject to the repayment and Finance  Charge terms for Standard Purchases. &nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldbodytext">(iii) Installment Purchases. </span>Each Installment  Purchase will be a part. If there is a balance owing on an Interest-free  Installment Purchase after the End Date, I authorize you to move, on or after  the End Date, that balance to the Standard Purchases part of the Account, and  it will be subject to the repayment and Finance Charge terms for Standard  Purchases. <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">b. When the Finance Charge begins. </span>The Finance Charge  begins to accrue on the transaction date, except Finance Charge does not accrue  during the Grace Period, if applicable to that part, and does not accrue prior  to the End Date on an Interest-free Installment Purchase.<br>

  <span class="boldbodytext">c. Grace Period. </span>You will not assess a Finance Charge on Standard or  Promotional Purchases during any Billing Cycle in which my payments and credits  on or before the Payment Due Date reduce the outstanding balance for Standard  and Promotional Purchases (excluding Standard and Promotional Purchases I made  during the Billing Cycle and Promotional Purchases which are subject to a  Deferred Payment option or a Deferred Interest option) to zero or to a credit  balance. No Grace Period will apply to a Promotional Purchase subject to a  Deferred Payment option, a Promotional Purchase subject to a Deferred Interest  Option, or to a Financed Installment Purchase. <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">d. How you will determine the balance on which the Finance Charge is  computed. </span>You will compute the Finance Charge for each part on the  "Average Daily Balance" (including new purchases) for that part  during the Billing Cycle. To get the Average Daily Balance for each part, you  will take the beginning balance for each part each day and add any new loans  and adjustments posted that day, including billed Finance Charges and billed Other  Charges; then subtract any payments and credits. This gives you the "Daily  Balance." Then, you add up all the Daily Balances for the Billing Cycle  for that part and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle.  The result is the Average Daily Balance for that part. You will treat any  Average Daily Balance which is a credit balance as zero.&nbsp; <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">e. How you compute the Finance Charge. </span>You will compute the Finance  Charge during the Billing Cycle for each part separately. For each part, you  will multiply the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle by the number of  days in the Billing Cycle; then you will multiply the product by the Daily  Periodic Rate in effect for that part during that Billing Cycle. The result is  the Finance Charge for that part. You will then add up the Finance Charge for  all the parts, to get the Finance Charge for the Account.<br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">f. Minimum Finance Charge.</span> If the Daily Balance of any part (excluding  any balance on an Interest-free Installment Purchase part), on the last day of  a Billing Cycle (the Statement Date), is greater than zero, and if the Finance  Charge for the Billing Cycle is greater than zero but less than $2.00, you may  assess a Finance Charge of $2.00 for the Billing Cycle.<br>

  <span class="boldbodytext">g. Rate of Finance Charge. </span>You will compute the Finance Charge on the  Standard, Promotional and Financed Installment Purchases parts using the Daily  Periodic Rate disclosed in the enclosed Important Disclosures. This corresponds  to the <span class="boldbodytext">ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE</span> disclosed in the enclosed Important  Disclosures. However, if you have disclosed a special promotional rate at the  time you made the special offer, according to law, you will compute the Finance  Charge on the Promotional Purchases parts using that special promotional rate. <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">10. OTHER CHARGES.</span> I agree to pay the following Other Charges, as  applicable. I agree that you may allocate any Other Charge to the Standard  Purchases part of the Account. <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">a. Late Fee. </span>You will charge me a Late Fee for each month the Minimum  Payment is not paid in full by its Payment Due Date. The amount of the late fee  is disclosed in the Important Disclosures.<br>
  No Late Fee will be due if the reason the Payment is late is either: <br>

  (i)  attributable to a Late Fee assessed on an earlier payment; or<br>
  (ii) because, after default, the entire balance on this Account is due. <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">b. Return Check Fee. </span>You will charge me a service charge of $25.00  if my payment on this Account is made with a check, including a draft, order or  other instrument that is returned by a drawee for "not sufficient  funds" in the account on which the check is written. You will not charge  the service charge, however, if you redeposit the check and it is paid. <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">c. Fee for providing a copy of billing statement. </span>Unless you are  required by law to provide me with a copy of a billing statement for a Billing  Cycle other than the current Billing Cycle, I agree to pay you a fee of ten  dollars ($10.00) per billing statement if I request a copy. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldbodytext">11. MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE.</span> The Minimum Payment will be due each Billing  Cycle, on or before the Payment Due Date. The amount of the Minimum Payment Due  will be the sum of the Monthly Plan Payments due on each Installment Purchase  part plus the payment due for the revolving parts plus any amounts past due  from previous Billing Cycles. <br>

  <span class="boldbodytext">a. Revolving Parts. </span>The payment due for the revolving parts will  be the greatest of (A) $10.00; or (B) 3% of the sum of the balances on the  revolving parts (excluding any balance subject to a Deferred Payment Option),  on the last day of the Billing Cycle; or C) 1% of the sum of the balances on  the revolving parts (excluding any balance subject to a Deferred Payment  Option), on the last day of the Billing Cycle plus any Finance Charges assessed  on the Account in that billing cycle (excluding any accrued Finance Charges on  a balance subject to a Deferred Payment Option or a Deferred Interest Option  that have been billed in that billing cycle), plus any Late Fees and Other  Charges assessed on the Account in that billing cycle. The payment will be  rounded down to the next whole dollar. <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">b. Installment Parts.</span> The Monthly Plan Payment due for each  Installment Purchase which has not reached its End Date and on which a balance  is outstanding will be the installment payment amount I agree to when I make an  Installment Purchase. The Monthly Plan Payments for an Installment Purchase  will be calculated so that they are substantially equal over the term of the  Installment Purchase. In no event, however, will the Monthly Plan Payment due  for any Installment Purchase be greater than the outstanding balance due on  that part of the Account. The Monthly Plan Payment due on the End Date may be  more or less than the others, because it will be adjusted as necessary to pay  the actual balance and accrued Finance Charge owing on the End Date. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">12. PREPAYMENT.</span> If I pay an amount greater than the Minimum Payment Due  in any Billing Cycle, this will not affect the way you calculate the amount of  the next Minimum Payment, and I will nevertheless make the Minimum Payment the  next Billing Cycle.<span class="boldbodytext"> I MAY MAKE PAYMENTS IN ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE  MINIMUM PAYMENT AND MAY PAY THE ENTIRE BALANCE OR ANY PART OF IT AT ANY TIME  PROVIDED THAT I PAY AT LEAST THE MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE IN EACH BILLING CYCLE WHEN  IT IS DUE. </span><br>

  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">13. PAYMENT APPLICATION.</span> You will use each payment that I make, when I  am not in default, first to pay billed Monthly Plan Payments on the Installment  Purchases (in any order you choose), then billed Finance Charge, then billed Other  Charges, then the principal balance of the revolving parts (in any order you  choose), and then any other amounts due. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">14. BILLING STATEMENTS.</span> You will provide me with a billing statement for  each Billing Cycle in which: <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">a.</span> You impose a Finance Charge to this Account; or<br>

  <span class="boldbodytext">b.</span> The New Balance is more than $1.00 (whether a credit or debit  balance). </p>
<p class="bodytext">I  agree to notify you in writing of any errors in the billing statement within 60  days from the date it is provided. I agree to examine the billing statement and  to notify you in writing, immediately, of any purchases which were not made or  authorized by me. You need not provide a billing statement to me if you deem  this Account uncollectible or if delinquency collection proceedings have been  started. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">15. DEFAULT.</span> I will be in default if any of the following happen: <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">a.</span> If I fail to pay any Minimum Payment Due on or before the Payment  Due Date. <br>

  <span class="boldbodytext">b.</span> If I fail to keep any promise or perform any duty in this Agreement,  or in any other loan or agreement with you. <br>
  If  default occurs, you will have no duty to make loans or advances from this  Account and this Account will be Terminated. You may refuse to make any new  loans and may cancel any approved loans from the Account for any Purchase or  transaction that has not yet appeared on a billing statement sent to me. This may  happen without any prior notice to me. If you choose, at your sole option, to  make new loans from this Account after default, I agree that you may charge  those loans to this Account. In addition, if a default occurs, all amounts  which I owe under this Agreement shall be due and payable immediately, at your  option (subject to any applicable law to the contrary); you may apply any  payments I make after default to satisfy the amounts I owe on any part of the  Account, in any order you choose. The other provisions of this Agreement will  continue to apply to this Account. If you get a judgment after default and/or  if I am a debtor in an action filed by or against me under the Bankruptcy Code,  unless prohibited by applicable law, the rates of Finance Charge applicable to  this Account will continue to apply to the balances on this Account. A default  under this Agreement is a default under every other account or loan which I  have with you.<br> 
  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">16. TERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNT.</span> <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">a.</span> In addition to  Termination by default, you may Terminate this Agreement at any time and for  any reason subject to the requirements of applicable law. <br>

  <span class="boldbodytext">b.</span><strong>&nbsp; </strong>I can terminate my Account by sending written  notice to the address on the billing statement. <strong>c.&nbsp; </strong>If there is no debit or  credit on this Account for twelve (12) consecutive months, you may terminate  this Account without notice to me.&nbsp; <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">d.&nbsp; </span>After Termination, I will not be able to make  new purchases on this Account. Termination under this paragraph will not affect  any purchase which complies with this Agreement and which was made before the  date of the Termination notice. If you choose, at your sole option, to allow  purchases after you have Terminated this Account (whether or not I have given  you notice Terminating this Account), I agree that you may charge those  purchases to this Account. After Termination under this paragraph, balances  will continue to accrue Finance Charges until paid in full and I agree to pay  the balance on this Account, the Finance Charges and all other amounts due in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All other provisions of this  Agreement will continue to apply.<br> 
  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">17. YOUR LIABILITY.</span> You have no  responsibility for the failure of any Merchant to accept payment using the Bill  Me Later Payment System. Your liability, if liability is provided under  applicable law, for a wrongful failure to make a loan on this Account is  limited to my actual damages. Failure to make a loan for any reason as provided  under the terms of this Agreement will not be wrongful.<br> 
  <span class="boldbodytext"><br>

  18. AMENDMENT OF THIS  AGREEMENT.</span> You may amend this Agreement from time to time, in any respect by  giving me written notice where required by law. An amendment may change  something in this Agreement (for example, the rate of Finance Charge on any or  all the parts), add something new or take something out. Such amendments will  apply to outstanding balances and new loans, except as otherwise indicated in  the written notice or provided by applicable law. This Agreement, except when  amended in accordance with this Agreement, is the final expression of the  Agreement between us and may not be contradicted by evidence of any alleged  oral agreement.<br> 
  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">19. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.</span> Your remedies under  this Agreement shall be cumulative and not alternative.<br> 
  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">20. DELAY IN  ENFORCEMENT.</span> You can delay enforcing any of your rights under this Agreement  without losing them. Any waiver by you of any provision of this Agreement will  not be a waiver of the same or any other provision on any other occasion.<br> 
  <br>

  <span class="boldbodytext">21. ASSIGNMENT.</span> I may not assign or  otherwise transfer my rights and privileges under this Agreement, or delegate  my obligations to repay amounts I owe to you. Any attempt to assign or delegate  will be void and of no effect. You may assign any and all of your rights under  this Agreement at any time without my consent. Any person, company or bank to  whom you assign this Agreement shall be entitled to all of your rights under  this Agreement. None of my rights or obligations shall be affected by such  assignment.<br> 
  <br>

I agree that  your customer service department may place telephone calls to me using an  automatic dialing and announcing device for any reasonable business purpose.<br> 
  <br>
  <span class="boldbodytext">25. GOVERNING LAW AND  CONSTRUCTION. </span>This Agreement has been accepted by you in the state of Utah, and all loans will be extended by you in the state  of Utah.  Regardless of the state of my residence or the place where the Merchant is  located, I agree that the provisions of this Agreement relating to interest,  charges and fees shall be governed by federal law and construed in accordance  with federal law and, as made applicable by federal law, the law of the state  of Utah. Other terms and provisions shall be governed by and construed in  accordance with the law of the state of Utah,  without regard to principals of conflicts of law, except to the extent preempted,  superseded, or supplemented by federal law.<br>

  <br>
  This notice is required  by federal law. In this notice, "you" and "your" mean the  Borrower. "We" and "our" refer to the Lender.<br>
  This notice  contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under  the Fair Credit Billing Act. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="italbodytext">Notify  Us In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill.</span><br>
  <br>

  If you  think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction  on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at Bill Me Later, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium,   MD 21094.  Write us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after  we send you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can  telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give  us the following information: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li class="bodytext">Your name and account number. </li>
  <li class="bodytext">The dollar amount of the suspected error. </li>
  <li class="bodytext">Describe the error and explain, if you can, why       you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the       item you are not sure about. </li>
</ul>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="italbodytext">Your Rights and Our  Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written Notice.</span><br>
  <br>

  We must  acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by  then.<br>
  <br>
  Within 90  days we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill was  correct.<br>
  <br>
  After we  receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or  report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you  question, including Finance Charges. You do not have to pay any questioned  amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts  of your bill that are not in question. If we find that we made a mistake on  your bill, you will not have to pay any Finance Charges related to the  questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay Finance  Charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned  amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and  the date that it is due. <br>
  <br>
  If you fail  to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent.  However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten  (10) days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we  report you to that you have a question about your bill, and we must tell you  the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to  that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is.<br>

  <br>
  If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50.00 of the  questioned amount, even if your bill is correct.
