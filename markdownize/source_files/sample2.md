### Section 1
I am the first sentence in the first section.  I am the second sentence in the first paragraph of the first section.  Soon there will be a second paragraph in the first section.  So we can see how things are separated.

I am the first sentence of the second paragraph of the first section.  Hopefully people are still reading.  Studies show that someone makes a decision to continue reading after the first 10-15 seconds, so by this point, people may be already starting to checkout of this content.  I should have started with something about Nicki Minaj or Kendal Jenner's underboob instagram pics or something.  I'll post a link later.


### Section 2
I am the first sentence in the first paragraph of the second section.  I guess I don't know yet if there will be a second paragraph, so it might not <span rn-plenti-header><strong>AAAA!!!</strong></span> be accurate to say the "first" paragraph.  I should have omitted that.  Or maybe "the first of possibly many paragraphs" is more  descriptive.  That one works.  It's got an optimistic feel that I think will make people more willing to believe whatever next bull i say.
