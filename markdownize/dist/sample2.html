    <p>I am the first sentence in the first section. I am the second sentence in the first paragraph of the first section. Soon there will be a second paragraph in the first section. So we can see how things are separated.</p>
    <p>I am the first sentence of the second paragraph of the first section. Hopefully people are still reading. Studies show that someone makes a decision to continue reading after the first 10-15 seconds, so by this point, people may be already starting
      to checkout of this content. I should have started with something about Nicki Minaj or Kendal Jenner&apos;s underboob instagram pics or something. I&apos;ll post a link later.</p>

    <p>I am the first sentence in the first paragraph of the second section. I guess I don&apos;t know yet if there will be a second paragraph, so it might not <span rn-plenti-header=""><strong>AAAA!!!</strong></span> be accurate to say the &quot;first&quot;
      paragraph. I should have omitted that. Or maybe &quot;the first of possibly many paragraphs&quot; is more descriptive. That one works. It&apos;s got an optimistic feel that I think will make people more willing to believe whatever next bull i say.</p>
